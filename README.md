# eSports-guide
Currently, I've been brainstorming ideas on building a personal project that is relatable to my own interests.  As an avid eSports watcher, I often find myself explaing the rules and win coditions of competative games to my girlfriend.  Because of this experience, I've decided to build an eSports viewing guide for people that don't watch eSports often.  The goal would be to have a quick reference website that gives the bare minimum knowledge needed to understand an esport.  The target audince would be for gamer's non gamer friends and family who need a quick explination on what's going on and what is significant.
